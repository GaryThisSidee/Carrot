# Carrot - An nft platform 

Carrot is a platform for creating and viewing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). It allows users to easily create unique digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded on the blockchain.

The platform is built using the Algorand NFT SDK and Flask, a popular web development framework. Algorand provides the backbone for the platform's blockchain infrastructure, allowing for secure and efficient creation and transfer of NFTs. Flask provides a simple and efficient way to build the platform's web interface, allowing for easy interaction with the underlying blockchain.

Creating an NFT on Carrot is a straightforward process. Users can upload an url,upload the meta data and set a name. Once the NFT is created, it can be viewed in the assets section.

# Technical Details

Carrot is built using the Algorand NFT SDK and Flask. The Algorand SDK provides a simple and straightforward way to interact with the Algorand blockchain, allowing for the efficient creation and transfer of NFTs. Flask, on the other hand, provides a lightweight and flexible web development framework, allowing for the creation of the platform's user-friendly interface.

The platform is designed to be scalable and highly secure, using state-of-the-art encryption techniques to protect users' data and assets. Additionally, the use of the Algorand blockchain ensures that all transactions are transparent and tamper-proof, providing an added layer of security for users.
